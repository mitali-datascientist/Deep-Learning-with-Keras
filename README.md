# Deep-Learning-with-Keras

First I practiced on how neural networks and Deep Learning models are created . 

Next I used Naive Bees dataset of Images and built a simple Deep Learning model using Keras, Scikit learn library and other popular Python libraries to classify between Bumble bees and Honey bees

I have been practicing on different datasets and guides available to get a clarity on concepts of Deep Learning. Here, I have referenced to the Tensorflow Guide. 

The Fashion MNIST Dataset is used to classify the images of clothes according to their labels such as shoes, sneakers, pullovers , tshirts etc. The model has an accuracy of 88%.
